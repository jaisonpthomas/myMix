# myMix

- Backend for a music subscription service. Allows subscribers to rent albums and for myMix administrators to manage the service.
- RESTful API built with Node.js, with a MongoDB database.
- Unit and Integration testing built with Jest.

This development was done as a personal project based from Mosh Homedani's excellent [Node.js API course](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-master-class/).
